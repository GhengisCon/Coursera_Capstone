If he could know where there would be demand for a new shop and not too much other competition he could pick that area.\n- I plan to use the foursquare location data to get locations of all mechanics in the Washington, DC area. I will leverage this data to predict where the prosctive business owner could open a new shop. \n- If i can find a location with crashes and few mechanics it might be a sign that there is demand for a new shop at that area. \n- my steakholders would be any mechanics looking to open a new shop."
